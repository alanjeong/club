# University of Oregon Data Science Club

Welcome to the University of Oregon Data Science Club!

### What are we?

### Misc
* **Join our Gitter Chat:** There are Study Groups all around the world. We use an online [Gitter Chat](https://gitter.im/mozillascience/studyGroup) to connect and share resources and ideas (you can sign in with GitHub, or using a Twitter ID if you're not set up on GitHub just yet). If you'd like to say hello, please introduce yourself in the chat, tell us where you are, and what you're thinking about or planning for your new Study Group. We're looking forward to meeting you.
* **Read the code of conduct:** this Study Group Program is for everyone - we abide by a [set of rules](https://www.mozillascience.org/code-of-conduct/) that require everyone be treated with respect. Help us make a space where everyone feels welcome, and we'll all have a better time!
* **Watch this repo:** up in the top right, there's a button that says 'Watch'; click it, and set yourself to 'Watching'. This will send you email notifications of new discussions; if you don't want email, but would like an alert just on GitHub, change the setting in Settings -> Notification Center (Settings is the little cog in the top right).
 
If you are new to GitHub, don't worry, [there's an introduction to it here](https://mozillascience.github.io/study-group-orientation/3.1-collab-vers-github.html).
